Life support and essential resources
====================================


1.  General overview
--------------------
Colonists must have their basic needs fulfilled in order to be able to live and
work. This amounts to:
  a.  Breathable atmosphere
  b.  Adequate nutrition
  c.  Sufficient living space


1.  Atmosphere
--------------
Maintaining a breathable atmosphere is of prime importance, without which
everyone in the colony will perish immediately.

The atmosphere within the colony is maintained by scrubbers. These machines
require power to function. A standard scrubber can supply air for up to 20
colonists. Since it is easy for a single scrubber to fail, it is highly advised
at least several redundant machines.

If the colony's scrubbers are overloaded, the air within will start to decay.
How quickly this occurs depends on the number of colonists versus the number of
functional scrubbers. Having a decayed atmosphere within the colony will
inevitably lead to violence within a short time, as well as making the remaining
scrubbers more likely to break down. A severely depleted atmosphere will cause
colonists to die off one by one.


2.  Nutrition
-------------
Colonists must be fed in order to work. Failure to supply enough food will
result in famine, gradual death, and will likely end in a revolt.

Food can be either imported or produced on site, in hydroponic farms.
Farming is inevitably linked to a long latency period in which no food is
produced, which can be as long as 3 months (6 turns). When the harvest is ready,
adequate storage space must be available, or else the produced food will go to
waste.


3.  Living space
----------------
Adequate living conditions are vital to keep colonists productive. Shelter is
provided by barracks, each of which can house up to 15 colonists. It is,
however, not advised to fill barracks to more than 80% their maximum capacity,
since cramped conditions make colonists much more likely to riot.
