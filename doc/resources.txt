1.  Mineral resources
---------------------
### Regolith
The top level of rock covering the planetoid. This rock is poor in minerals,
but relatively rich in water, which can be further refined into heavy water and
tailings. Can also be directly used to make mooncrete. Regolith is gathered by
scrapers.


### Ore
Rock mined underground in areas that have been confirmed to contain viable
concentrations of metals. The composition of a given batch of ore is randomized,
but always contains at least 25% metals by weight. Ore can be refined into pure
metals. Ore is mined with drilling machines, which produces tailings as a side
effect.


### Tailings
Finely crushed rock that has had its metal content removed. Only useful as a
substrate for mooncrete. Tailings are usually in abundant supply, since all
mining operations produce large amounts of tailings (which also counts as
work for mining machines).


2.  Building materials
----------------------
### Mooncrete
Concrete-like building material that is easily made. Cheap, but not particularly
durable against any sort of attack.


### Steel prefabricate
Prefabricated sections of construction steel that can be quickly assembled into
a building. Faster to build and stronger than mooncrete, but expensive and
difficult to make.


### Machine components
Parts used to build and repair basic machines.


### Electronics
Parts necessary for the construction and maintenance of advanced technologies.





3.  Finished products
---------------------
### Scraper
Machine used to gather regolith. Requires 1 worker to operate (unless equipped
as autonomous).


### Drill
Machine used to extract ore. Requires 1 worker to operate (unless autonomous).


### Construction robot
Machine that speeds construction work (equivalent to 10 colonists). Manned by
1 worker (unless autonomous).


### Slugs
Ammunition for railguns, made from a heavy metal.


4.  Metals
----------
### Iron
The most common metal, appears in large amounts nearly everywhere. Used to
make steel and machine components, as it is generally not worth exporting.

    Relative value: 1
    Relative abundance: 100

### Copper
A less abundant, but still common, metal used primarily for electronics. Can be
worth exporting during periods of high demand.

    Relative value: 3
    Relative abundance: 30


### Tungsten
A somewhat rare, heavy, dense metal. Required in many applications where extreme
heat and abrasion is encountered, such as drill cutting blades. Generally
profitable to export.

    Relative value: 20
    Relative abundance: 5


### Platinum
A rare, noble metal. Commonly used as a catalyst, it is invaluable in devices
such as scrubbers. Also a lucrative export, for the above reasons.

    Relative value: 50
    Relative abundance: 1


### Uranium
Rare, radioactive metal. Useful as a fission reactor fuel. Reasonably valuable
export as well.

    Relative value: 35
    Relative abundance: 1
