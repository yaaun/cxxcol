CXXCol initial design document
==============================


1.  Concept
-----------
CXXCol (working title) is intended to be a text-based, space-themed 4X strategy
game. Its scope is deliberately limited in order to speed development.

The primary gameplay focuses on the management of a planetoid mining colony.
The main objective is to extract, refine and export rare metals in order to
fulfill a fixed quota.

Among the dangers that await the player are such things as:
  * solar flares (all times)
  * shortages of life support resources (early stage)
  * pirate attacks (once the colony is rich enough)
  * planetoid instability (once a critical amount of minerals has been mined)
